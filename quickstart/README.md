# Overview

The quick start guides in the sub directories will walk through
deploying a CloudSQL instance, dev Vault Server, as well as
configuring the `vault-plugin-database-cloudsql` plugin.
Each directory will deploy/configure the same components
just using different tooling.

* **cli**: uses `vault` cli and `gcloud` cli.
* **terraform**: uses `vault` cli and `terraform`.
